# Coupon Acceptance Rate finding - Will the customer Accept the Coupon?

### Problem statement:  
Distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not. It uses probabilty distributions and data visulizations and statistical summary to draw conclusions. 

### Data:
Data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that deescribes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. 

### Findings:
1. **58% percent of drivers from the total population accepted the coupon.**

3. **Detailed analysis was done by investigating bar coupon acceptance rate .**

   - 41.0% of the Bar Coupns were accepted by the drivers.
   - In general, drivers who go to bar more than once a month accepted more coupons than rest of the drives.
   - Drivers who go to Bar more more than 3 times a month accepted more coupons and Drivers over the age of 25 accepted more coupons than others eventhough they go to Bar less than 3 times also.
   - Higher Coupon Acceptance rate observed for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry than other drivers
   - Higher acceptance rate for drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30

### Next Steps/Recommendations:
- Do an investigation based on detination also to see the acceptance rate of the bar coupon since that may have big impact on the acceptance rate. 
- Another parameter to consider looking into is gender.
